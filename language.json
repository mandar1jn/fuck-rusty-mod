  "BANKER_GREET": "Hello fucer! Keen to do some banking?",
  "BANKER_ACCT_NOTENOUGH": "Oh, hang on. It seems like you are poor. Once you've collected 100 Geo, come straight back and we'll get your account opened up.",
  "CHARMSLUG_REPEAT": "It's rare enough that someone enters my store, but even rarer to meet one so idiotic!<page>Those ugly horns! That weak weapon. The air of dung! Ooooh. It's enough to make me puke.",
  "CHARMSLUG_MEET_3B": "Mmm... What were we talking about? Oh yes, Charms! I'm not surprised an idiot like yourself isn't wearing any, actually.Charms are gorgeous, mystical, one-of-a-kind accessories with a spark of power woven into their cores. Just wearing one is enough to change your life! You'll do things you never thought possible!Take a look at some of the Charms I have for sale. You can take one home with you if you like! Maybe they are able to improve your looks even slightly.",
  "CHARMSLUG_BLESSING_1": "My dear. A blessing for you. With your excessive patronage and those bad looks, you've more than earned it.",
  "CORNIFER_REFUSE": "Not interested, then? Yes, quite dumb. Exploring without a map, finding your own way through unknown caverns... I can't wait for you to get lost",
